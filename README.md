## Objective
* To create an exprimental testing ground for learning React.

## Structure
* Is currently a basic single page React/Next.js application

## Design rationale
* Since I have Vue experience and both Vue and React are considered JavaScript front-end frameworks, I assumed they weren't too dissimilar in regards to generating a local development environment. For this reason I started by following a quick [installation guide](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) to create a new React project.
* I decided to install Material UI as a way to quickly give me components to experiment ideas with as my focus is not on designing UI components with raw JavaScript.

## Retrospection
* In the future, may consider linting options and exploring end-to-end testing with Cypress.

## Scripts

In the project directory, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
